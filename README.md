#### Students; William Bennett, Alex Karadjov
#### Teacher: David Elliot
#### Project Due Date: May 12th

## Project Overview
### For this project, we will need to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a sucessful movie production.

## Business Undertanding

### Business Question
- Your company has now seen all the other big companies creating original video content. 
- Your companies board have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies.

### Business Proposal
- We are _charged_ with exploring what types of films are currently doing the **best at the box office**.
- We then _translate_ those findings into **undstandable** and **logistical** formats
- All inorder to give an insightful **conclusion** on what type of films are the _best to be creating_.


#### The _best_ at the box office.
What does **best** mean:
- money
- rating, won’t line pockets
- consistency

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


The presentation describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It must include at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.
