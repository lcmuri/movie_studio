# New Movie Studio: Data-Driven Decision Making

## Overview
This project explores factors influencing financial and audience success in the film industry. By leveraging data from Box Office Mojo, IMDb, and other sources, we provide actionable recommendations to guide production strategy in a competitive landscape.

## Business Problem
The movie studio is entering a crowded content market. Strategic decisions are essential to ensure profitability while optimizing production and distribution.

## Data Analysis Approach
We examined key metrics such as:
- Domestic vs. International revenue 
- Production budgets and their impact on ROI
- Genre profitability trends
- Influence of IMDb ratings on revenue

## Key Findings
- **International Markets Matter:** Some films, like _Avatar: The Way of Water_, achieve exceptional global success.
- **Budget vs. Profitability:** Larger budgets correlate with higher gross revenue (correlation = 0.78) but do not strongly impact ROI (correlation = -0.05).
- **Profitable Genres:** Crime, drama, family, and horror/mystery/thriller yield strong ROI, while action-comedy hybrids show lower profitability.
- **Ratings Impact:** Higher IMDb ratings can boost revenue but are not a direct indicator of ROI.

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize Cost Efficiency:** Enhance production efficiency without sacrificing quality.
- **Focus on High-ROI Genres:** Invest in crime, drama, family, and horror/mystery/thriller genres.
- **Avoid Overinvestment in Action-Comedy Hybrids:** Optimize resources for better profitability.
- **Leverage International Success:** Tailor marketing strategies to maximize global audience engagement.
- **Strategic Release Timing:** Schedule films for peak seasons to maximize viewership.

## Next Steps
- Conduct deeper audience demographic analysis for top-performing genres.
- Test and refine marketing and budget strategies.
- Present insights to stakeholders for iterative improvements.

## Conclusion
By integrating data-driven strategies, the studio can optimize production choices and maximize profitability in a highly competitive landscape.
